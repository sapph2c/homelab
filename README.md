## Hardware

Dell Optiplex 7050 mini Desktop.

### Specs

- Processor: Intel Core i5-7500
- RAM: 16GB DDR4
- Storage: 1TB M.2 SSD

## Changelog

(8/15/2025) Migrated from PowerEdge R710 to Dell Optiplex 7050 mini Desktop.

Reasons:
- Impossible to move an enterprise server from Upstate NY to the Bay Area.
- The mini PC uses substantially less power than the PowerEdge
- I do not need the 64 cores and 92GB of RAM that the R710 offered.
